# Awesome phages

A curated list of awesome Phage related software, resources, and libraries. Mostly command line based, and free or 
open-source. Please feel free to contribute!

## Annotation

- **[VIRify](https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline)** - VIRify: detection of phages and eukaryotic
viruses from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies

### Host prediction

- **[phirbo](https://github.com/aziele/phirbo)** - A tool to predict prokaryotic hosts for phage (meta)genomic
sequences. The tool uses information on sequence similarity between phage and bacteria genomes as well as sequence
relatedness among bacteria _[biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.05.425417v1)_

### Prophage prediction

- **[hafeZ](https://github.com/Chrisjrt/hafeZ)** - A tool for identifying inducible prophage elements through read
mapping _[biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.21.453177v1)_
- **[DBSCAN-SWA](https://github.com/HIT-ImmunologyLab/DBSCAN-SWA)** - an integrated tool for rapid prophage detection
and annotation.
  - [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199018v1.full)
- **[Phigaro](https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro)** - Phigaro is a standalone command-line application that is able
to detect prophage regions taking raw genome and metagenome assemblies as an input.
- **[PhageBoost](https://github.com/ku-cbd/PhageBoost)** - Rapid discovery of novel prophages using
biological feature engineering and machine learning
- **[PhiSpy](https://github.com/linsalrob/phispy)** - PhiSpy identifies prophages in Bacterial genomes. Given an
annotated genome it will use several approaches to identify the most likely prophage regions.
- **[Vibrant](https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/VIBRANT)** - VIBRANT is a tool for automated recovery and annotation
of bacterial and archaeal viruses, determination of genome completeness, and characterization of viral community
function from metagenomic assemblies.
- **[VirSorter2](https://github.com/jiarong/VirSorter2)** - VirSorter2 applies a multi-classifier, expert-guided
approach to detect diverse DNA and RNA virus genomes..

### Annotation

- **[multiPhATE2](https://github.com/carolzhou/multiPhATE2)** - MultiPhATE is a command-line program that runs gene
finding and the PhATE annotation code over user-specified phage genomes, then performs gene-by-gene comparisons among
the genomes.
- **[Phanns](https://github.com/Adrian-Cantu/PhANNs)** - PhANNs is a tool to classify any phage ORF as one of 10
structural protein class, or as "others". It uses an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks.
  - [web](https://edwards.sdsu.edu/phanns)
- **[Phanotate](https://github.com/deprekate/PHANOTATE)** - PHANOTATE is a tool to annotate phage genomes. It uses the
assumption that non-coding bases in a phage genome is disadvantageous, and then populates a weighted graph to find the
optimal path through the six frames of the DNA where open reading frames are beneficial paths, while gaps and overlaps
are penalized paths.
- **[Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)** - Prokka is not phage specific but is often used to annotate phages.

### Web tools

- **[Patric](https://www.patricbrc.org/)** PATRIC, the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center, provides integrated data and analysis tools to
support biomedical research on bacterial infectious diseases.
- **[Phamerator](https://phamerator.org/)** - Comparative genomics and genome exploration tool for bacteriophages.
  - [github](https://github.com/scresawn/phamerator)
- **[RAST](https://rast.nmpdr.org/)** - RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) is a fully-automated service
for annotating complete or nearly complete bacterial and archaeal genomes. It provides high quality genome annotations
for these genomes across the whole phylogenetic tree.
- **[Phaster](https://phaster.ca/)** - Rapid identification and annotation of prophage sequences within bacterial
genomes and plasmids.
  - [pmc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987931/)
