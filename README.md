# Awesome phages

A curated list of awesome Phage related software, resources, and libraries. Mostly command line based, and free or 
open-source. Please feel free to contribute!

## Annotation

- **[VIRify](https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/emg-viral-pipeline)** - VIRify: detection of phages and eukaryotic
viruses from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies

### Host prediction

- **[phirbo](https://github.com/aziele/phirbo)** - A tool to predict prokaryotic hosts for phage (meta)genomic
sequences. The tool uses information on sequence similarity between phage and bacteria genomes as well as sequence
relatedness among bacteria.

and annotation.

- **[Phigaro](https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro)** - Phigaro is a standalone command-line application that is able
to detect prophage regions taking raw genome and metagenome assemblies as an input.
[ [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/598243v1) ]
- **[PhageBoost](https://github.com/ku-cbd/PhageBoost)** - Rapid discovery of novel prophages using biological feature
engineering and machine learning
[ [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.243022v1.full) ]
- **[PhiSpy](https://github.com/linsalrob/phispy)** - PhiSpy identifies prophages in Bacterial genomes. Given an
annotated genome it will use several approaches to identify the most likely prophage regions.
- **[Vibrant](https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/VIBRANT)** - VIBRANT is a tool for automated recovery and annotation
of bacterial and archaeal viruses, determination of genome completeness, and characterization of viral community
function from metagenomic assemblies.
[ [paper](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00867-0) ]
- **[VirSorter2](https://github.com/jiarong/VirSorter2)** - VirSorter2 applies a multi-classifier, expert-guided
approach to detect diverse DNA and RNA virus genomes..
[ [paper](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00990-y) ]

### Annotation

- **[multiPhATE2](https://github.com/carolzhou/multiPhATE2)** - MultiPhATE is a command-line program that runs gene
finding and the PhATE annotation code over user-specified phage genomes, then performs gene-by-gene comparisons among
the genomes.
[ [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.05.324566v1) ]
- **[Phanns](https://github.com/Adrian-Cantu/PhANNs)** - PhANNs is a tool to classify any phage ORF as one of 10
structural protein class, or as "others". It uses an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks.
[ [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.023523v1) ]
- **[Phanotate](https://github.com/deprekate/PHANOTATE)** - PHANOTATE is a tool to annotate phage genomes. It uses the
assumption that non-coding bases in a phage genome is disadvantageous, and then populates a weighted graph to find the
optimal path through the six frames of the DNA where open reading frames are beneficial paths, while gaps and overlaps
are penalized paths.
[ [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6853651/) ]
- **[Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)** - Prokka is not phage specific but is often used to annotate phages.

### Web tools
